# Intuition
The problem requires finding elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times, where n is the length of the array. One way to approach this problem is to iterate through the array, count the occurrences of each element, and keep track of those elements that meet the condition.

# Approach
1. Iterate through the array.
2. For each element, count its occurrences in the array.
3. If the count exceeds ⌊n/3⌋, add the element to the result list.
4. Ensure that the result list contains at most two elements that satisfy the condition.
5. Return the result list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2) - Two nested loops are used to iterate through the array.
- Space complexity: O(n) - The result list may contain up to two elements that meet the condition.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            ele = nums[i]
            count = 0
            if ele not in res:
                for j in range(n):
                    if ele == nums[j]:
                        count += 1
            if count > (n//3):
                res.append(ele)
            if len(res) > 2:
                break

        return res
```
